# Swing-GUI-Calculator
A basic calculator developed using Swing GUI on NetBeans 8.1

'Calculator' folder contains the jar executable of the application and can be copied to run stand-alone.
'Source' contains the project source code as exported from NetBeans.

The GUI was designed using the integrated Netbeans GUI, the downside of which was a lot of redundant code that was generated. The code was refactored and redundant code was removed by copy-pasting the code into a new class to remove the lock placed by NetBeans on the generated code.

Calculator only accepts mouse input. Keyboard input isn't supported yet.
